My name is Tobi Akere, Iâ€™m in my freshman year of college and plan to pursue a career in computer science at  UNT Denton. 
I've always been curious to find a way to connect my creativity and my passion for coding into one domain and I eventually 
came across Web Development. I've been practicing new skills like coding, and software development to prepare myself for 
the competitive field. Over time, coding has become a hobby for me, and I'm prepared to face any formidable challenges that get in the way.
